* apt-fast-mirrors
A fastest mirror selector for apt-fast. Currently only works on Debian

To fetch the fastest mirrors and add the 10 fastest to the `MIRRORS` variable in `/etc/apt-fast.conf`, run:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo python3 af-mirrors.py
#+END_SRC

The fastest mirror is also added to `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/sources_<repo>.list`.

** Prerequisites

*** Install apt-fast

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:apt-fast/stable
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install apt-fast
#+END_SRC

*** Install dependencies

To ensure the script functions as intended, install `lsb-release`, `netselect-apt`, and `netselect`:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo apt-fast install lsb-release netselect-apt netselect
#+END_SRC

**** Netselect on Ubuntu

`netselect` and `netselect-apt` are not available in the Ubuntu repositories by default. They can be installed by downloading the Debian packages and installing them manually:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
wget http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/n/netselect/netselect_0.3.ds1-30.1_amd64.deb
wget http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/n/netselect/netselect-apt_0.3.ds1-30.1_all.deb

sudo dpkg -i netselect_0.3.ds1-30.1_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i netselect-apt_0.3.ds1-30.1_all.deb
#+END_SRC
